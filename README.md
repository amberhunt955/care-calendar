<h1 align="center" id="readme-top">Care Calendar</h1>

<p align="center">You meet a lot of people in your lifetime, and it's not always easy to keep in touch with everyone you want to. This MERN stack app will help users maintain relationships with those for whom they might have lost touch with otherwise. When logging in, users will be provided a list of the day's birthdays and anniversaries - inspiring them to reach out to their connections.</p>

Features ->
<ul> 
  <li>Users can add contacts and keep track of significant dates for each of them</li>
  <li>Each contact includes a log where users can add a short summary every time they reach out - thus saving them the awkwardness of later forgetting important details about their contacts</li>
</ul>

<p>Whether it's a positive date - such as a birthday or friendiversary - or a negative date - such as the loss of a family member or pet - be reminded to reach out to your friends when it matters most.</p>

## Vision and Wireframes

You can visit my [Trello board](https://trello.com/invite/b/30PksrxI/ATTI178b1b4349880bae71166c83c08262b42C510E8B/ps-final-app) to see how I planned and organized tasks for completing this project.

Before beginning this app, I created three wireframes to organize my thoughts around the three most important views I planned the app to display. These views were the main page containing the events of the current date (and a carousel to see a preview of upcoming dates), the profile page for contacts, and the contact log containing a user-generated summary of important updates about each contact. You can view these wireframes below.

I also created an Entity-Relationship-Diagram to plan and map the flow of data:

## Challenges

Understanding how to implement CRUD in full stack applications. Particularly, how to update data.

## What Did I Learn?

After completing this app, I feel like I have a much better understanding of how routing works in the backend.

## Future Improvements

I hope to add a lot more features in the future!

These features include, but are not limited to:
<li>Full CRUD for events dataset</li>
<li>Creating a relationship between events and contacts</li>
<li>Adding additional datasets, such as a conversation log for each contact</li>
<li>Displaying data specific to the logged in user</li>
<li>Improved styling, accessibility, and responsiveness</li>

## Acknowledgements

I used [draw.io](https://drawio-app.com/) to create my wireframes and ERD.

[Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) is the BEST website for picking a color scheme.

I had a lot of really good conversations with my classmates Mayleen and Shoshana throughout the week, which was very helpful in completing this project!

Thank you also to my instructors Abraham and Colton for helping me work through some challenging errors.

Finally, thank you to everyone in my cohort - you've all helped me grow so much over the past 15 weeks! It's been an honor learning with you.
