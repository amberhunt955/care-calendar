<h1 align="center" id="readme-top">Per Scholas Final Project - Special Day Tracker</h1>

<p align="center">You meet a lot of people in your lifetime, and it's not always easy to keep in touch with everyone you want to. This MERN stack app will help users maintain relationships with those for whom they might have lost touch with otherwise. When logging in, users will be provided a list of the day's birthdays and anniversaries - inspiring them to reach out to their connections.</p>

<ul>Features 
  <li>Users can add contacts and keep track of significant dates for each of them</li>
  <li>Each contact includes a log where users can add a short summary every time they reach out - thus saving them the awkwardness of later forgetting important details about their contacts</li>
</ul>

<p>Whether it's a positive date - such as a birthday or friendiversary - or a negative date - such as the loss of a family member or pet - be reminded to reach out to your friends when it matters most.</p>

## Technologies Used

## Vision and Wireframes

You can visit my [trello board](https://trello.com/invite/b/30PksrxI/ATTI178b1b4349880bae71166c83c08262b42C510E8B/ps-final-app) to see how I planned and organized tasks for completing this project.

Before beginning this app, I created three wireframes to organize my thoughts around the three most important views I planned the app to display. These views were the main page containing the events of the current date (and a carousel to see a preview of upcoming dates), the profile page for contacts, and the contact log containing a user-generated summary of important updates about each contact. You can view these wireframes below.
